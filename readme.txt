== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why do I need this? =
Recent studies have shown that roughly two out of every three shopping carts are abandoned.

= How does it work? =
This plugin inserts an asynchronous tracking code on your checkout page, and conversion code on your receipt page. When a customer visits the checkout page, Rejoiner captures their email as soon as it's entered. When they abandon the cart, your remarketing email campaign begins at your predefined intervals.
